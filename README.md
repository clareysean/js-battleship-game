## A web-based take on a classic game.

## About:

In Battleship, each player takes a turn guessing the position of their opponent's ships on a 10x10 grid. In my version, red indicates a hit, while gray indicates a miss. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships is the winner.

The pieces and their respective lengths are:

- Carrier: 5
- Battleship: 4
- Cruiser: 3
- Submarine: 3
- Destroyer: 2

## Getting Started:
